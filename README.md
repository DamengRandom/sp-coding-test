## Getting Started

First, install the npm packages before starting the app 

```bash
yarn install
or 
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev 
```

* (Hi Johnny, in order to make the code run, I will send you the two secret files via email)

Finally, run test command to run unit tests:
```bash
yarn test
```


## Project Structure (Development/Design roadmap)
1. Considered to utilise tailwind for css (efficiency and tidy)
2. Implemented Atomtic Design Methodlogy to design React components
3. Written some unit tests fork key features development (API requests) 
4. Using React hook form + yup for form data handling
5. Utilised modern React developmemnt libraries and tools to build web app efficiently
6. Tried to think the most better UX for this app (eg: server side rendering (SSR), styling)
